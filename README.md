This package presents the modelling code for book Biophysical Models and Applications in Ecosystem Analysis (Jiquan Chen 2021). It contains five modules: weather, photosynthesis, respiration, evapotranspiration, and global warming potential. The code is primarily for educational purpose.

To get start with the package, please go through the help folder and see the instruction for implementing models in the coding environment.

Author comment: I previously worked with Jiquan for the coding development, but the way of its publication is not decided yet before the next edition of the book. Therefore, the work has to be paused temporarily. Please cite the book rather than the package itself when using the code inside.
