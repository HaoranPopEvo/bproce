This package presents the modelling code for book Biophysical Models and Applications in Ecosystem Analysis (Jiquan Chen 2021). It contains five modules: weather, photosynthesis, respiration, evapotranspiration, and global warming potential. The code is primarily for educational purpose, and may in the future be attached to the book for the next edition.

To get start with the package, please go through the help folder and see the instruction for implementing models in the coding environment.
