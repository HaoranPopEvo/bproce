\title{Calculate PET using Blaney-Criddle model}
\usage{
m4.PET.BlaneyCriddle(ta, dhour)
}
\arguments{
\item{ta}{daily mean temperature (â—¦C). A vector.}

\item{dhour}{the total daytime hours for the period used. A vector.}
}
\value{
vector of potential water use (PET) for a reference crop (mm).
}
\description{
Calculates daily potential evapotranspiration (mm) based on Blaney-Criddle model.
It is used to estimate ET for the western USA. Calculated PET is the potential
water use for a reference crop.
